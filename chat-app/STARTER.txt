Directory structure:
- client
- flask-server

client has the react application
while flask-server has the flask application (this can be simply run by 'python main.py'), 
incase you don't have the module, you can install it using 'pip install <module>'

to run the client you must install node and npm

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

you can download it from here

if successful

type the following into a shell to verify
node -v
npm -v

(if you install node, npm should be automatically installed)

if these commands successfully output a version number you are good to go

you then need to run 'npm start' inside the client directory to start the project. The flask app should be running too

then the application will automatically be activated on your default browser, (port 3000 for frontend, 5000 for flask)

#### To run the frontend
go to "venv" vistualenv and activate it
run python3 /Users/navid/Documents/rasa_practice/XAIBot_V1/chat-app/flask-server/main.py


#### To retrain the NLU model with new data
you need two files:
- RASA_NLU/data/nlu.yml
- RASA_NLU/domain.yml

To have materials to modify above files:
- run intent_creator_batch.py
For each dataset that is present in the components.py, two files be added to these folders:
- created_intents [goes into nlu.yml]
- intents_entities [goes into doamin.yml]

After modifying these files, in the RASA_NLU folder:
- run >> rasa train
- unzip the generated model
