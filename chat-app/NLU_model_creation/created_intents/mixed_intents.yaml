    - why the model has classified [instance 88](record) as lab?
    - why the model sees [instance 0](record) as [virginica](label) ?
    - why the model predicted this class for ins?
    - why [instance 14](record) becomes [setosa](label) ?
    - how come model predicts [setosa](label) for ins?
    - why you classified [instance 73](record) as [virginica](label) ?
    - why the model decided to predict this label for [instance 112](record) ?

  examples: |
    - why the [instance 4](record) is classified as [virginica](act_label) , instead of [virginica](des_label) ?
    - why the model didn't classify [instance 25](record) as [setosa](des_label) ?
    - i was expecting to see [versicolor](des_label) as the class oof the [instance 111](record) !
    - why the model decided to go for [setosa](act_label) instead of [virginica](des_label) for the [instance 14](record) ?
    - for the [instance 45](record) , why not the [setosa](des_label) instead of the current one ?
    - why the model predicted [virginica](act_label) as the output for the [instance 47](record) instead of [virginica](des_label) ?
